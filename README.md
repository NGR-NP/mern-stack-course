## React main file [index.js](https://github.com/NGR-NP/mern-stack-course/blob/E-commerce-ui/src/index.js)

This Project is a React application that utilizes the Redux library to manage state and the Redux Persist library to persist the state to local storage. The main file, index.js, serves as the entry point for the applicaton.

1. The application is wrapped in a React.StrictMode components for improved debgugging and performance, and the Redux Provider is used to provide the store to the rest of the application.

2. The PersistGate component is used to persist the state of the store to local storage, and the App component is passed as the child to the rendered with the PersistGate.
